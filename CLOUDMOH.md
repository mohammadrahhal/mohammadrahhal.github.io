# ***Git Intro***

- Version control system is used to revisit various versions of files and to correct the mistakes that may come with files.
- Local visual control system has one database on the hard disk that stores files.
- Centralized visual control system its need one server to store versions and changes of files which many clients can access.
- Distributed version control "Git" it makes clients create mirrored repositories (backups of data) to prevent the damage that a failure of the server can cause.
- Snapshots: they are created by Git when you save a changed version of your project.
- Local operations, which Git depends on, most necessary information can be founded by local resources.
- Tracking changes: Git tracks the directory every single change.
- Loss of data: Git minimize the number of damaged data.
- Local Git repository: it has working directory, index and head.
- Files of a project's copy could be in tracked or untracked state. 
- Tracked state means that files were part of the most recent file snapshot.
- Untracked state means that files were not in the last snapshot.
- There is a life cycle of a file status starting with changing or adding files, then commit files with all changes and then pushing changes to GitHub.
- Stashing changes: this happen when you are not ready to commit changes but you don't want to lose these changes.
