# Videos Notes:

## Video 1:
### **Introduction**
- The first video is an introduction to the playlist (How Computers work), you can find the playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAx_6-wdslM&list=PLzdnOPI1iJNcsRwJhvksEo1tJqjIqWbN-&index=1).

### **How computers work?
- You can find computers everywhere.
- Computers are machines that help us in thinking work.
- They are designed to manipulate information.
- Computers have to perform 4 different tasks.
  - Taking Inputs.
  - Storing Information.
  - Processing.
  - Output the results.
- Earliest computers were made of wood and metal with mechanical levers and gears, they were large and slow.
- Modern computers do not look as earlist ones, but they are doing the same process faster.
- A computer's processor takes the information from the memory, it can manipulate them using different algorithms.
- Algorithms are series of commands.
- Processed information are stored also in the memory again.
- The output of one computer can be the input for another one via versa.

## Video 3:
### **Binary & Data
- Computer works on ones and zeros.
- Inside the computer, there are electrical wires and circuits that hold data.
- Electrical wire that hold current may be on or off, yes or no, true or false, and 1 or 0.
- **Bit** is the state of one wire, which is the smallest information in the computer.
- Binary Number System has two digits: one and zero.
- The number of wire indicates the number that we can count to 2^(no. of wires).
- Sounds, pics, videos are all stored as binary.

## Video 4:
### Circuits and Logic
- Every input or output of a computer is effictively a type of information.
- Not Circuit: take the input and the output will be inverted.
- And Circuit: all of the inputs have to be 1 to get true, if one of them is zero then the output will be false.
- Logical Circuits:
  - And
  - Nand
  - Or
  - Nor
  - Not
  - Xor
- Complex circuits are made of the connections of the previous circuits.
- Mathmatical operations can be performed using these circuits.
- Smaller circuit: less distance the electrical signal has to go.

## Video 5:
### CPU, Memory, Input and Output
- Input devices take the inputs from outside world and convert them to binary.
- Memory store the information.
- CPU: "Central Processing Unit" where all the calculations are done.
- Output devices convert the information into physical output.

## Video 6:
### Hardware and Software
- The hardware is all parts that you can see inside the computers.
- The software is the part that you cannot see.
- Software can be computer programm, code, or series of commands.
- CPU is controling all other parts of computer, it recieves commands and decide which circuit has to deal with this command.
- There are modern ways to write a project, which are easier and more simple than binary code.
- The Operating System manges how the software gets to use the hardware of the computer.
